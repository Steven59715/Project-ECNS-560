### Topic

### The impact of Migration on Housing Prices in the US

### Motivation

Migration is the movement of people from one place to another. This can happen internationally when people move from one country to another, or it can happen internally as people move within the same country.Migration can be temporary or permanent, voluntary or forced.It can also be seasonal.

Numerous factors, such as economic opportunities, escaping conflict or persecution, reuniting with family, or educational purposes, inform migration decisions for people moving between nations. Family, employment, educational pursuits, or other interests are some of the underlying reasons people may choose to relocate within the U.S. 

Housing prices stand for the cost of purchasing properties, such as houses, apartments, or condominiums. Immigration significantly impacts all facets of the US economy, including the housing market. We want to investigate the impact of immigrants’ influx (both domestic and foreign) on local housing prices, considering also the demand and supply factors in the market such as interest rates and general population increases.

### Why It Matters

Firstly, it is crucial for policymakers as it aids them in making informed decisions regarding immigration, which in turn helps to stabilize housing prices, ensuring affordability and a high standard of living. 

Furthermore, it can facilitate the establishment of a stable market, as both homeowners and renters have a reasonable insight into the fluctuations in the housing market. 

Finally, it can also function as a guide for urban planning and infrastructure development.

### Research Questions

1. What is the relationship between migration and housing prices. (Descriptive, Predictive)

2. How does the effect on housing prices vary according to counties? (Descriptive)

3. The distribution patterns of migration and housing prices across states and time. (Descriptive)

4. The impact of urbanization driven by migration on housing prices. (Descriptive)

### Data Description

#### Migration Data Sets 

(https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-migration-data-2013-2020)
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provided the data. The migration is based on year-to-year address changes reported on individual income tax returns filed with the IRS. We use county-level data from 2013 to 2020. The migration data consists of both the inflows and outflows of people within and outside the country. 
N1 is the number of returns filed, approximating the number of migrated households. 
N2: number of personal exemptions claimed. Which approximates the number of individuals. The size of adjusted gross income (AGI) and the age of the primary taxpayer determine Agi, the aggregate migration flow at the state level. It is reported in thousands of dollars.

#### Housing Prices Data Set

(https://www.fhfa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-09/UADAggs_county_v3_2.zip)
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) provided the housing price data set. We used the uniform appraisal dataset—aggregate statistics on appraisal—from the FHFA. An appraisal is an assessment of a property's value performed by a certified appraiser.
 It is quarterly data. The data spans from 2021- to 2022-year period.
Value is the worth of the statistical series.
Quarter – 1 = January – March
2 = April-June
3 = July-September.
4 = October-December
5 = all four quarters (yearly)
NB: For this research purpose we are using 5 which represent annual housing value.
Geoname is the formal name of a geographic unit (counties).

#### Prime Interest Rates

The control variable is interest rate from 2013 to 2020.  The interest rates were scraped from the JP Morgan Bank website and averaged by year.

### How Migration data and Housing data are related.

There is a close relationship between migration data and the housing data set. Migration patterns can directly influence the demand for housing. Areas facing elevated levels of immigration may see increased development to meet demand. This can affect housing prices depending on how fast supply can catch up.

The two data sets were merged by year and the state and county FIPS code.

### Data Processing

#### Migration Data

There were no missing values. We changed the column names to make them more descriptive. We kept only county-level inflow data in the data set. Each year has its own file. Because the migration data is based on tax return filings, it may not accurately reflect the actual migration into the county, as some individuals who move in and out may not file a tax return.

#### Housing Prices Data

The Federal Housing Finance Agency "suppressed" some housing prices for counties with fewer than five values, even though we had no missing values. However, since our focus is on the housing market, we used all data from purchase prices in the data set for housing values, excluding refinance appraisals. The final data set included only data for the fifty states and the District of Columbia. We subset the housing price data by year, using the state and county FIPS codes as keys to join each year's migration data. We bound all the years into a single data frame for analysis, adding the average prime interest rate for each year as a separate column. The skewed distributions of both the migration and housing price data prompted a log transformation.

```


#### Finding 1: The relationship between migration and housing prices

```{r}
# Create a scatter plot of LOG_MIGRATION vs. LOG_VALUE with a smoothing line
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x=LOG_MIGRATION, y =LOG_VALUE)) +
# Add points with low transparent

  labs(title = "Immigration and Housing Prices Relationship", x="Migration (Log Transformed)", y = "Housing Prices (Log Transformed)") +
# Add a smooth line to show trend  
  geom_smooth()
```


There is a clear positive non-linear relationship (upward-sloping pattern) between migration and housing prices. This indicates that as the number of migrants increases, housing prices also tend to increase. The points are tightly clustered around a linear trend suggesting a high correlation.

#### Finding 2:  How does the effect on housing prices vary according to counties? (Descriptive)

Riverside County experiences the most significant and consistent increase in housing prices, followed by Los Angeles County, which also sees a steady upward trend. King County and Harris County show moderate increases over the years. Other counties, such as San Bernardino, Tarrant, and Wake, have slower but steady growth in housing prices. Overall, there’s a clear upward trend in housing prices across most counties, with notable differences in the rate of increase.


Most of the counties with the highest migration inflow vary by year in similar ways. Los Angeles County consistently has the highest migration inflow, although it declines over time. New York County also sees a significant decrease in inflow. Some counties, like Maricopa and Riverside, show gradual increases or stable trends in migration inflow toward 2020. There is notable fluctuation in migration patterns across counties during the observed years. For example, in 2015, most of the counties experienced lower migration, but in 2016–2017, most of the top ten counties saw increases in annual immigration. This implies that a factor associated with each year could influence immigration in all these counties.

The boxes show the interquartile range (IQR), which is the range from the 25th percentile (bottom edge of the box) to the 75th percentile (top edge of the box).The line within each box represents the median house price for that county. Whiskers extend from the box to indicate the range of house prices within 1.5 times the IQR. Individual dots represent potential outliers that fall outside this range. Maricopa County has the highest median and overall spread for house prices. Harris County has a wide IQR and median house price but shows a larger spread than most other counties, suggesting a significant variation in house price. San Diego County also shows a wide range, with both a high median and notable spread in house prices. Counties like King County, Tarrant County, Collin County, Wake County, and San Bernardino County have relatively narrow distributions, with lower median values and smaller ranges, indicating less variability in house prices. Counties like King County, Tarrant County, Collin County, Wake County, and San Bernardino County have relatively narrow distributions, with lower median values and smaller ranges, indicating less variability in house prices. Outliers are present in Collin County and Wake County, represented by individual dots outside the whiskers. These house price observations exceed the typical values for these counties. This plot indicates that housing price varies significantly across these counties. Counties like Maricopa and San Diego have high house prices and wide ranges, while others (like Collin, Wake, and San Bernardino) have lower house prices and less variation.

This box plot above provides a summary of the migration  for the top 10 counties.
Los Angeles County has the highest median migration among the counties and shows a relatively wide range, suggesting a high variation in migration.
Maricopa County and San Diego County also exhibit high inflows, but with narrower distributions than Los Angeles County, indicating less variation.
Counties like New York County and Broward County show lower median migration and a narrower range, suggesting more consistent migration numbers with fewer outliers.

From the graph above, States like Arizona (AZ) and Florida (FL) show consistently high migration levels, peaking around 2016 before declining. Migration trends might be influenced by factors like affordability, job opportunities, and quality of life.


The graph illustrates housing price trends. While prices generally increase across all states, some states, Arizona (AZ) has the highest and most consistent rise in housing prices, peaking in 2018, followed by California (CA), which also sees a steady increase. Other states, like Connecticut (CT), Delaware (DE), and Rhode Island (RI), exhibit slower but noticeable growth in housing prices over the years.

This box plot illustrates the distribution of housing for the top 10 states. Each box plot represents the spread and central tendency of the house price for each state. DC (District of Columbia) has the highest median house price with a narrow distribution, suggesting that the values are high and relatively consistent. CA (California) and MA (Massachusetts) show a wider spread, indicating significant variability in the house price variable within these states. NJ (New Jersey) has a few low outliers, showing some unusually low values compared to the rest of its distribution. HI (Hawaii) and MD (Maryland) have lower median house prices compared to other states, with relatively narrower distributions, indicating more consistent but lower values.


This box plot represents the distribution of migration for the top 10 states, providing insights into how migration varies across these states.
DC (District of Columbia) has a higher median inflow and a smaller spread, meaning its migration inflows are relatively high and consistent with few outliers.
NJ (New Jersey) and MA (Massachusetts) have wider distributions, indicating higher variability in migration inflows.
AZ (Arizona) and FL (Florida) also have a wider spread, suggesting significant variation in migration inflows, including some high outliers.
DE (Delaware), RI (Rhode Island), and HI (Hawaii) have lower median inflows and narrower ranges, indicating more consistent but lower migration numbers.


### Econometric Analysis

### Motivation
Many factors that may not be easily quantifiable influence individual migration decisions. To provide a quantitative perspective on the relationship between housing price and migration, we conducted a regression analysis. We cannot specifically claim causal inference because of a lack of clear counterfactuals,even though we controlled for some of the variations within state and year and also controlled for prime rates across years. Therefore, the obtained results do not prove causation, but rather they depict a consistent pattern within the data sets. 


### Method
To estimate the impact of migration on housing prices, we used a linear fixed effects model that includes average prime rates as a control variable to account for other variation that the state and year fixed effects could not capture.


```{r}
# Rename columns in the clean_data_PR dataset
clean_data = clean_data|>
  rename(
# Rename the column "VALUE" to "HOUSING_PRICE"    
    HOUSING_PRICE = VALUE,
# Rename the column "NO_OF_INDIVIDUALS(INFLOW)" to "MIGRATION"
    MIGRATION = `NO_OF_INDIVIDUALS(INFLOW)`
  )
```


```{r}
# Add new columns with log-transformed values to the clean_data_PR dataset
clean_data = clean_data |>
  mutate(
# Create a new column "LOG_HOUSING_PRICE" by applying the natural log to "HOUSING_PRICE"    
    LOG_HOUSING_PRICE = log(HOUSING_PRICE),
# Create a new column "LOG_MIGRATION" by applying the natural log to "MIGRATION"
    LOG_MIGRATION = log(MIGRATION)
  )

```



```{r}
# Fit a simple linear regression model
# LOG_HOUSING_PRICE is the dependent variable (outcome).
# LOG_MIGRATION is the independent variable (predictor).
simple_reg= lm(LOG_HOUSING_PRICE~ LOG_MIGRATION, data=clean_data)

# Summarize the regression model results in a tidy format
tidy(simple_reg)
```


Using the within estimator fixed effects
```{r}
# Fit a fixed-effects regression model using plm
fix_reg = plm(
  LOG_HOUSING_PRICE ~ LOG_MIGRATION, 
# Specifies the panel data structure: "STATEPOSTAL" as cross-sectional index and "YEAR" as time index  
  index = c("STATEPOSTAL", "YEAR"),
# Use the "within" model for fixed-effects estimation
  model = "within", 
# specifies the dataset containing the variables
  data=clean_data
  )

# Summarize the regression model results in a tidy format
tidy(fix_reg)
```

With control variable  
```{r}
fix_reg_control = plm(
  LOG_HOUSING_PRICE ~ LOG_MIGRATION + AvePR, 
#Defines the panel data structure (STATEPOSTAL for states, YEAR for time periods)  
  index = c("STATEPOSTAL", "YEAR"),
#Specifies a fixed-effects model  
  model = "within", 
#Specifies the dataset containing the variables for the analysis
  data=clean_data
  )

# Summarize the regression results in a tidy format
tidy(fix_reg_control)
```

### Results

```{r, results='asis'}
# Generate a formatted regression table
stargazer(
#The regression model object from plm  
  fix_reg_control,
#Specifies the output format  
  type = "html",
#Title for the regression table
  title = "Regression Output",
#Custom label for the dependent variable in the output table
  ep.var.labels = "Log of Housing Price",
#Custom labels for the independent variables
  covariate.labels = c("Log of Migration", "Average Prime Rate"),
  digits = 3
)
```


### Interpretation
From the results, we can tell areas with higher levels of migration also have higher housing prices. As migration increases by 1 percent, housing prices also increase by approximately 1.14 percent. The data reveals the crucial correlation between migration and housing prices. The P value associated with this estimate is <0.01, which is below the conventional threshold for significance of 0.005. This means that the estimate is significant and reliable. 

Average prime rate: For every unit increase in the average prime rate, it is associated with approximately a 21 percent increase in housing prices. The p-value associated with this estimate is <0.01, which is highly significant, indicating that average rates and housing prices are highly correlated.


### Limitations

Our data analysis encounters several limitations that could potentially undermine the results of our regression. First, omitted variable bias. Other variables, not captured in our data set and subsequent regression analysis, may influence the effect of housing price increases. Variables such as income, employment rates, etc. may significantly influence housing prices. Also, the analysis shows relationships between migration, prime rates, and housing prices, but it does not prove that one causes the other. Other unmeasured factors, like government policies, economic shocks, or local market conditions, could influence these variables. Lastly, we adopted the fixed effects model in estimating our analysis. While fixed effects control for unchanging factors within each state and year, they do not account for time-varying factors unique to individual states, which might still influence housing prices.


### Conclusion

The influx of individuals into an area typically increases the demand for housing and often leads to higher prices due to limited supply and competition. Economic growth also correlates with migration, as people gravitate towards regions offering better job opportunities and rising wages, thereby intensifying the demand for housing. In some cases, migration can instigate gentrification, where wealthier newcomers raise property values in lower-income neighborhoods, potentially displacing long-term residents. Higher average prime rates often occur during periods of economic growth and inflation, which can push housing prices up. In a growing economy, despite rising costs of borrowing, buyers may still be willing to pay higher prices because their incomes and investments are also increasing. Sometimes, rising prime rates signal tighter monetary policies. This can lead to a temporary spike in housing prices as buyers rush to secure loans before rates climb even higher.


### Policy Implications

To address rising housing prices driven by migration, local governments should focus on building more affordable housing, rezoning for higher-density areas, and encouraging people to move to less crowded regions by improving infrastructure and job opportunities. To manage the effects of rising prime rates, governments can provide low-interest loans or subsidies for first-time buyers to keep housing affordable. Additionally, stricter lending standards can help prevent risky borrowing and speculative bubbles that drive prices even higher.
